A stupid game like Snake,use pgzero(python3.8.10)
I am a 14-year-old boy who studies in Wuhan, a great city, and China, a great country.
I have the idea of making this project because one of my friends made it with scratch.
We spent much time on his project. 
When I learnt pgzero, I thought I can also make one project like his, with python.
The at 2022-3-7, I started doing it.
A hard work for me, because I am a poor programmer. I just do it for fun, but not for future work.
I finished the first code which can play with no bugs at 3-8, but it was really easy and ugly.
Today, 3-12, I made it more beautiful and more fun.
That's all. Thanks for reading. Hope we can make this project more fun!

--a problem: I do not know why it cannot upload a exe file."Something went really wrong"
